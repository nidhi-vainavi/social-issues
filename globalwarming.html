  <p> Global warming, the phenomenon of increasing average air temperatures near the surface of Earth over the past one to two centuries.
     Climate scientists have since the mid-20th century gathered detailed observations of various weather phenomena
     Human activity affects global surface temperatures by changing Earth's radiative balance—the “give and tak e” between what comes in during the day and what Earth emits at night.
     Climate change includes both the global warming driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases, and the resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns.
     Global warming refers to global averages, with the amount of warming varying by region.
     Patterns of warming are independent of the locations of greenhouse gas emissions, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet; however, localized black carbon deposits on snow and ice do contribute to Arctic warming.
     The Earth is warming up, and humans are at least partially to blame.
      The causes, effects, and complexities of global warming are important to understand so that we can fight for the health of our planet.
      Global warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earth's average surface temperature over the past century primarily due to the greenhouse gases released by people burning fossil fuels.
      Agricultural source of greenhouse gases worldwide. Each year, a single cow will belch about 220 pounds of methane, which is shorter lived than carbon dioxide but 28 times more potent in warming the atmosphere, said Mitloehner, a professor and air quality specialist in the Department of Animal Science.
